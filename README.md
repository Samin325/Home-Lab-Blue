# Homelab for Security Detection & Monitoring

This is a homelab created following Day CyberWox’s blueprint and documentation, available on his website (https://cyberwoxacademy.com/building-a-cybersecurity-homelab-for-detection-monitoring/). It’s been changed slightly to use the more recent, up-to-date software versions and technologies. The lab was created using VMWare Workstation Pro 17; you don’t need to buy a licence upfront since VMWare offers a 30-day free trial, which is what I will be using.
